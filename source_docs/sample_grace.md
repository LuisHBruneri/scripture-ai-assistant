# The Doctrine of Grace

Grace is defined as the unmerited favor of God toward humanity. It is central to the Christian faith, emphasizing that salvation is a gift and cannot be earned by works (Ephesians 2:8-9).

## Key Aspects of Grace

1.  **Prevenient Grace**: The grace that goes before salvation, drawing the sinner to God.
2.  **Justifying Grace**: The grace that declares a sinner righteous through faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 3:24).
3.  **Sanctifying Grace**: The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to transform the believer into the image of Christ.

"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast." - Ephesians 2:8-9 (ESV)
